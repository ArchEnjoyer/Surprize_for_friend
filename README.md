I have a super cool friend and onse upon a time he had a birthday
We live in different sities so I make this simle code
It works on Windows OS
You can make .exe file with pyinstaller and rename it like exgpj.exe or Algpj.exe
Then you can enter special UTF-code symbol that reflects left-to-right
here: ex {} gpj.exe; Algpj.exe
         
After that: exexe.jpg (it's like hahaha in Russian) and Alexe.jpg (Alexey without y)    
You can also give an .ico and it will look like you give him just a photo

This file will fastly open wordpad and starts typing message
You can change message to what you want
